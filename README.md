# WebDevStudios Simple Page Builder
Uses existing template parts in the currently-active theme to build a customized page with rearrangeable elements.

**Requires CMB2** -- If CMB2 is not loaded, this plugin will not work.

Uses existing template parts in the theme to dynamically build a custom page layout, *per page*. An options page allows you to define your template part directory (if you wanted to keep these template parts separate from other template parts) and the template part prefix you are using.

Dynamically add template parts within the Edit Page screen and reorder those components.

The results are saved to post meta on the page and visible as soon as you save the page.
